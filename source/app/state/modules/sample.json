These two data flows are handled automatically so that the only interface the CMS users have with the stream, and the endpoint, is WCH. The data is received via elastic distributed infrastructure to ensure that no data records are lost from the data velocity coming from the stream. Records are processed synchronously so as to not overload WCH (given that WCH has maximum api calls per minute that it has to adhere to so as not to overload the infrastructure). ",

ARIA offering enables CDO's to get simple answers and new insights to complex questions by analyzing client's enterprise-wide \"dark\" data and integrating the results with real-time external sources. Organizations gain the ability to easily and efficiently leverage insights from the entire collection of organization data and external sources - structured and unstructured, active and dark. Using cognitive algorithms and advanced analytics, we deliver cross-document synthesis, surfacing of business and consumer insights, and interconnection to external contextual data. Moreover, all of these features are integrated into a cognitive engine that gets smarter over time, learning from user feedback, and leveraging deep learning to make connections in language, images, and data. A typical use case for Aria is enabling marketing teams to leverage years of unstructed consumer market research and reports by searching using natural language. In this way, Aria delivers increased efficiency for teams across your organization , cost reduction, and ultimately optimized decision making.",

Billing abd budget Insights: Analyzes legal invoices, which contain narrative (unstructured) task description from Outside Counsel, and compares them to: (a) historical invoices, and (b) the company's billing guidelines. It vastly expands the amount of data that can be analyzed for context providing greater insights for evaluating and selecting Outside Counsel. Performance insights: Outside Counsel sends their corporate clients everything they file with the court. Thus, corporate law departments have a repository of unstructured benchmarking data regarding the activities Outside Counsel pursued and their effectiveness in similar matters (i.e. outcome of motions, success before certain judges, with an opposing party, etc.). Cognitive Legal Insights ensures that companies pay the right amount to the right client for the right defense.",

IBM’s Virtual Agent for Telco offering provides availability for CSRs to focus on value add, specialized, or “one off” scenarios that require exceptions and research. This is achieved this through its ability to synthesize written and spoken language to understand the intent of a user's phrase or question and provide an appropriate response. As part of natural language processing, Watson is trained to narrow down the intent of a sentence to be its underlying meaning or goal—ultimately, to grasp what someone means, regardless of how they say it. This translates into an increase in reach of organizational knowledge at scale, increase accessibility of customer support, improvement in the speed of answers, and a nearly infinite scale to process information and store visibility of patterns in consumer engagements to improve future communication. The benefits which are directly correlated to return on investment (ROI) include: \rImprovement in customer satisfaction: Expected 10-15% improvement in customer satisfaction by increasing first contact resolution with contextually relevant answers that can either be custom-trained or pre-trained which also removes employee performance variability in many standard Q&As\rReduction in cost for operations: Expected 20-40% call deflection rate from higher cost channels, based on industry, allows customers to engage with Watson first and your live agents to increase attention to higher impact issues and resolution\rEfficiency of resources: 80% reduction in agent research time to complete calls allows your live agents to be more productive) \r30% improvement in cross-sell to close ratio",

    "assetDescription": "Real Estate represents the second largest cost on most companies balance sheet, and accounts for as much as 60% of the total energy consumed today. According to Herman Miller, individual workstations are unoccupied as much as 60% of the time. Furthermore, companies are sub-optimizing building maintenance, over maintaining some assets and under maintaining others, spending as much as 20-50% more than necessary on maintenance. Today's commercial buildings represent a prime opportunity for improved efficiency, both in the operation of the building itself, and through improved effectiveness of the workers who occupy them. Teaming with some of the world's largest and most respected Building Services companies including ISS, Siemens and Honeywell, IBM is uniquely positioned to offer IoT solutions in the Building marketplace. IBM is recognized as the leader in bringing new value to the Building optimization space. We combine our market leading IoT solutions with our global building consultancy, delivering to customers a vendor neutral offering that can support any building manager/building services customer, in any industry anywhere in the world.

Unlike other market offerings, Cognitive Manufacturing Advisor builds a model using advanced machine learning techniques to reflect an operation or asset in a plant.  The model is adjusted with output from unstructured data like plant maintenance and operator logs (infrequently) and fed with sensor data (regularly).  The cognitive model updates itself (learns) while using the current data and makes recommendations for the operator to adjust the machine settings based on a goal set by the plant, energy efficiency, throughput, quality, etc. This is ideal for a COO who desires to create new streams of revenue by maintaining and operating plants on behalf of their customers. In 10 days, we can assess plant data and inefficiencies and have you in pilot within first 3 months to begin to realize the benefits. IBM is uniquely positioned to deliver Cognitive solutions in industrial settings leveraging the best of IBM Research, Cloud, and Analytics, combined with skilled consultants across the globe.\r",

This offering helps life sciences companies by adding speed, consistency and quality throughout their case processing, signal detection, reporting efforts for the critical function of monitoring drug and patient safety. Watson for Patient Safety will enhance signal detection in literature and real world data and provide integrated insights on signals that can drive better, more confidence decisions and initiatives in R&D and clinical trials by life science companies.
